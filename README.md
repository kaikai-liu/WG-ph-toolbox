# Waveguide Photonics Toolbox

This toolbox includes a [waveguide mode](http://photonics.umd.edu/software/wgmodes/) solver developed by the research group led by Professor Thomas E. Murphy at The University of Maryland as the core module, a module of the calculation of roughness induced scattering loss and resonance splitting, a module of the dispersion property calculation for nonlinear optics. 

## Full vector waveguide mode solver

Some functions are added to the original `modesolver` module to mesh the commonly used  or user-customized waveguide geometries , such as rectangular, fiber and D shape (`wg-photonics-toolbox/modesolver/tool_added`). Examples based on these added mesh functions can be found in `wg-photonics-toolbox/modesolver/examples_added`.
